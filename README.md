`MSs.zip` is meant to be Marine System Simulator however it does not successfully install in current matlab version so therfore the zip is provided instead. Once the issue is fixed the instructions will be updated.

- open matlab
- navigate to `src`
- add directory and subdirectories to path `src/MSS`
- run `init.m`
- open `part1.slx`
